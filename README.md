# Local_Homodyne_Measurement
Experimental Demonstration of local homodyne measurement.Calculation for the quadrature value and the approximation of the precision is evaluated.Calculation of variance for RF output is calculated, where a linera graph was obtained.Modification by subtracting the mean rf output value from overall values of experimental data, gave a monotonically deceasing trend for approximation of the precision values.
